        What is a Sleep Cycle?
      </h3>
      <p>
        A sleep cycle is a period during which your body progresses through
        different stages of sleep, from light sleep to deep sleep to REM sleep.
        Each cycle lasts approximately 90 minutes, and a healthy night's sleep
        consists of 4-6 complete cycles.
